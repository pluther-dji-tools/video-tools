# video-tools
A collection of tools used to manipulate DJI video files

These are some of the scripts that I've written/am writing to make use of the video and logs from my flights of my
DJI Phantom 3 4K drone.  I assume other DJI drones, and possibly drones from other manufacturers, may follow similar
formats, but I haven't chacked.

The overall goal is to map my flights and make a public database of images.  These will be mostly of sites of 
archaeological, geological, or paleoenvironmental interest in Central Oregon or the surrounding areas, (because that's
where I have friends who are various types of scientists who have asked for images.)

There will be several different tools, including:
- A script to read the SRT file created with each video and parse its contents to read into ArcGIS to map the flight.
- A script to extract frames from the video and convert them to geotagged images
- A database (somewhere) that will allow students, scientists, or anyone interested for any reason, to browse a map, see
where images exist, and view the image, a regional composite, or view the video of the flight.

I expect the code to improve as I continue to learn Python :)
